[Package Forge](https://github.com/pkgforge) is rethinking package management for Unix systems. We provide [thousands of statically compiled binaries](https://pkgs.pkgforge.dev), [portable packages](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) in formats like [AppImage and more](https://github.com/pkgforge/pkgcache), and a [fast, modern package manager](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar) written in Rust.
